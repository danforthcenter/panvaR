  maf = 0.05,
  missing_rate = 0.1,

}
\arguments{
\item{phenotype_data_path}{Path to the phenotype data}

\item{vcf_file_path}{Path to the VCF file}

\item{tag_snps}{The tag SNPs that you want to pass through panvar - either a single SNP or a list of SNPs.
A single SNP should be formatted as "\if{html}{\out{<Chr>}}:\if{html}{\out{<BP>}}" - For example, "Chr_09:12456" or "Chr08:14587".
To supply multiple tag SNPs supply a vector of tag SNPs. For example tag_snps = c("Chr_09:12456","Chr08:14587").}

\item{r2_threshold}{The r2 threshold
Defaults to 0.6}

\item{maf}{The minor Allele Frequency
Defaults to 0.05}

\item{missing_rate}{The missing rate filter for your genotype data
Defaults to 0.1}

\item{window}{PanvaR determines the Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between the tag Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and every other SNP within a genome segment. This segment is centered on the tag SNP, extending up to a specified window size in both directions.
Defaults to 500000}

\item{pc_min}{(optional) What is the minimum number of PCs that should be included in GWAS?
Defaults to 5}

\item{pc_max}{(optional) What is the maximum number of PCs that should be included in GWAS?
Defaults to 5}

\item{dynamic_correlation}{(optional) Should the PCs, beyond minimum, be calculated dynamically?}

\item{all_impacts}{(optional) Should all impacts be included in the report?
Defaults to FALSE - in which case only "MODERATES" and "HIGH" impacts will be included}
