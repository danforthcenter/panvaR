\usage{
ld_filtered_snp_list(path_to_bed_file, chrom, bp, r2_threshold = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_bed_file}{Path to the bed file that should have the tag SNP.}

\item{chrom}{The chromosome of the tag SNP.}

\item{bp}{The bp of the snp}

\item{(optional)}{The r2 threshold that you want to work with.
Defaults to}
}
\value{
A table with the list of BPs that cross the assigned threshold.
}
\description{
This function will take a Chrom, a BP, a Bed file, a r2 threshold and return
for that tag bp/tag SNP, a list of BPs that have are in LD beyond the r2 threshold.
Title
A function to return a list of BPs with LD beyond assigned r2 value
}
\examples{
ld_filtered_snp_list("<bed_file_path>", chrom = "<chorm>", bp = <bp_value>, r2_threshold = 0.6)
