\title{A function that automates the Panvar analysis when supplies genotype data and phenotype data.}
\usage{
panvar(
  phenotype_data_path,
  vcf_file_path,
  chrom = NULL,
  bp = NULL,
  r2_threshold = 0.6,
  maf = 0.05,
  missing_rate = 0.1,
  window = 500000,
  pc_min = 5,
  pc_max = 5,
  dynamic_correlation = FALSE,
  all.impacts = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phenotype_data_path}{Path to the phenotype data}

\item{vcf_file_path}{Path to the VCF file}

\item{r2_threshold}{The r2 threshold
Defaults to 0.6}

\item{maf}{The minor Allele Frequency
Defaults to 0.05}

\item{missing_rate}{The missing rate filter for your genotype data
Defaults to 0.1}

\item{window}{The window around the tag snp
Defaults to 500000}

\item{pc_min}{(optional) What is the minimum number of PCs that should be included in GWAS?
Defaults to 5}

\item{pc_max}{(optional) What is the maximum number of PCs that should be included in GWAS?
Defaults to 5}

\item{dynamic_correlation}{(optional) Should the PCs, beyond minimum, be calculated dynamically?}

\item{all_impacts}{(optional) Should all impacts be included in the report?
Defaults to FALSE - in which case only "MODERATES" and "HIGH" impacts will be included}
